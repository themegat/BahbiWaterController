This is a [**platformio**](https://platformio.org/) project, created in *VS Code*.

# BahbiWaterController

This project was created to run on the **ESP8266 (D1 - Mini)** development board to control a pump for watering purposes.

There is companion mobile application [**BahbiWaterApp**](https://github.com/themegat/BahbiWaterApp) used to control and monitor the *watering/pumping* process.

## Usage

**This project was created in Visual Studio Code using the PlatformIO extension, so make sure that you 
have Visual Studio Code installed and that the PlatformIO extension is installed in Visual Studio Code.**

*Although not tested yet, this project can probably be used in other IDE's such as Arduino IDE.

### Step 1

Connect a ESP8266 (D1 - Mini) to your development machine.

### Step 2

Then build and install the project.
#### That's all ... (You can either use the companion application or something like Postman to *contorl/monitor* the board).
